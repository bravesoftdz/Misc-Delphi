# Misc-Delphi
Miscellaneous units i wrote for different projects, they might be usefull to some people.

<b>untBottomPanel:</b><br>
A simple panel with predefined buttons i used in some projects. You can choose what buttons you want (OK + Cancel + Apply, OK + Cancel, Close).

<b>untHeaderPanel</b><br>
A simple panel with a Caption and SubCaption label and a right aligned image.

<b>untJSONParser</b><br>
A JSON Parser for Delphi - this only reads JSON, it does not convert objects/classes to JSON!

<b>untXCReloaded</b><br>
A Xtream-Codes API class, allowing easy navigation through a IPTV providers VOD and live streams. I used this unit in various projects, it utilises Indy for the HTTP, and the JSON parser unit.
